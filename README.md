## Description
First time i use another proggraming languange PHP, i'm enough happy for learn this languange. now, i create apps format website about result of matches football but not all league because i use API from *[soccerAPI](https://soccersapi.com/)*, i use free option on platform, when i use it, that platform restricted feature, now i use one league like league DENMARK(Super League).<br>
## Spesification
1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Languange)
2. CSS (Cascading Stylesheet)

4. API (Application Programming Interface)
5. XAMPP (Apache Server)
6. Bootstrap (Frameworkk HTML & CSS)<br>

## Flow
The first thing i turn on apache server on XAMPP so that can runnning PHP as programming languange, i use CDN (Content Delivery Network) on Bootstrap V5.1.1 and then i split any file become module like header and footer, i use feature default system bootstrap like card, and then i collect all function on 1 file only, why ?? because for long terms can maintenance become easier, i put on website feature for check matches tomorrow or yesterday.
